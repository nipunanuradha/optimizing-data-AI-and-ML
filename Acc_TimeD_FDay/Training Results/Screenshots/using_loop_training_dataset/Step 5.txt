@ Similar to optimiza_loop_train_dataset, but it might emphasize refining the dataset itself during iterations. For example, augmenting, normalizing, or selecting subsets of data in each loop.

@ Dynamic dataset manipulation can improve model robustness and performance. For example, augmenting the dataset in each iteration can simulate real-world variability.
